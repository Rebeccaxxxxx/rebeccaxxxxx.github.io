					<p id="e">Hello, I'm Rebecca Wei. I was born in Hubei, China on November 20th, 2000. My family moved to Shanghai when I was in primary school, so most of my childhood memories happened in Shanghai. During the last year of middle school, I decided to come to the US for high school, so I took an English language test and got into a Christian high school in Illinois. Now, I'm studying computer science at New York University. I really enjoy the life in New York, and love all my friends from NYU. For hobbies, I enjoy drawing, photography, singing, and traveling. Welcome! Let's be friends!</p>
